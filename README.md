## Idea Board

This is an idea board with a pre-built back-end server where you can temporally save the users' id and password plus every user is able to add, edit and delete ideas from the board by selecting the user's link.

Work with your classmates and colleagues to:

- Sketch two projects.
- Write three ideas for each project.
- Illustrate with titles what your data model might look like.

You can see this project running [here](https://pipe-mv.github.io/ideas-board/).
